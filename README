Custom skin

This is *fork* of the example skin showcasing the best practices, a companion to the
MediaWiki skinning guide available at
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Skinning>.

This fork is a personal project/challenge to see what I can do with a custom MediaWiki skin. I have ideas, some of them might work, some of them might not. It's not really meant to be something used by the masses, but if people want to use it, be my guest. Likely to be WIP for a long time. Also, please excuse the lack of a better name. I'm a coder, not an English major.
